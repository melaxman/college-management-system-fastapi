- (Optional) Docker & Docker Compose

---

### üíª Local Backend Setup (without Docker)

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/college-management-system-fastapi.git
   cd college-management-system-fastapi


2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```

3. Install Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure your database connection in `database.py` or via environment variables.

5. Run the backend server:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

# üê≥ Docker Deployment

This will run both FastAPI + PostgreSQL in containers.

1. Build and run using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. Access the app in your browser:

   ```bash
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

### Frontend Setup

- Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
- Ensure the backend is running and accessible at the expected URL (default `http://localhost:8000`).
- Use the login form to authenticate, then access and manage students, departments, and enrollments.
